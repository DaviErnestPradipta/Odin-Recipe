    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Sambal</strong> is an Indonesian chili sauce or paste, typically made from a mixture of chillis with secondary ingredients such as shrimp paste, garlic, ginger, shallot, scallion, palm sugar, and lime juice.
        <em>Sambal</em> is an Indonesian loanword of Javanese origin (<em>sambel</em>).
        In addition to Indonesian cuisine, sambal is also an integral part of the cuisines of Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, and Sri Lanka.
        It has also spread through overseas Indonesian populations to the Netherlands and Suriname.
        Different sambal recipes are served as hot and spicy condiments for dishes, such as <em>lalab</em> (raw vegetables), <em>ikan bakar</em> (grilled fish), <em>ikan goreng</em> (fried fish), <em>ayam goreng</em> (fried chicken), <em>ayam penyet</em> (smashed chicken), <em>iga penyet</em> (ribs), and various <em>soto</em> soups.
        There are at least 212 variants of sambal in Indonesia, most of which originate in Java
