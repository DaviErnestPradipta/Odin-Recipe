    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Nasi goreng</strong> is a Southeast Asian rice dish with pieces of meat and vegetables added.
        It can refer simply to fried pre-cooked rice, a meal including stir-fried rice in a small amount of cooking oil or margarine, typically spiced with <em>kecap manis</em> (sweet soy sauce), shallot, garlic, ground shrimp paste, tamarind and chilli and accompanied by other ingredients, particularly egg, chicken and prawns.
        There is also another kind of nasi goreng which is made with <em>ikan asin</em> (salted dried fish) which is also popular across Indonesia
